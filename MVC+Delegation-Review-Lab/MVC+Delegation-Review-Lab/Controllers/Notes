Custom Delegation

TODO: step1: Set up font size controller delegate
So we set a protocol and put it ABOVE the class, we should define a protocol and add the appropriate methods, properties, initializers etc the delegate is also optional so the default value is nil.
This delegate needs to be a weak reference. so make sure you add [weak var] our tab
step 2 create a function to change font size: declare a property that will be a weak reference to the delegate object

step3: use the delegate property to update the delegate object about  necessary: whenever you broadcast that change you need to do step 3.
whatever the delegate is you call that function( delegate?.didLongPress(self) )
you can put delegate?.didLongPress(self) but use a didSet(property observer: it observes for changes (listens for changes)) on my fontSize that gets called regardless who changes it.
Step4: When we are about to segue we have the instance there. Prepare for segue(or the gear). we need reference to the object we will need a notification from

Step:5 like in UITableView we need to set the delegate property
cell.delegate = self

step6: we need to conform to the ItemCellDelegate protocol and implement any required methods properties or initializers
extension MoviesVC: FontSizeControllerDelegate{
func didChangeFontSize(_fontsizeController: fontSizeController, fontsize: CGFloat) {
//code update the fontsize self.fontsize = fontsize
}
}
